MCBoxA - Move Chromeboxes Automatically

MCBoxA was developed to support automatic relocation of Chromeboxes. MCBoxA has an overview of every Chromebox' serial number, most recent user, where it is located (Device_OU) and where the most recent user is located (MRU_OU). It uses GAMADV-XTD3 to push fresh data to the two sheets Devices & Users, and then uses a number of formulas to calculate their current relationship, and decide what to do with the devices.						

I definitely recommend you read the contents of the scripts before running any functions. If for nothing else at least so you know it looks like it'll only do what I say.

_**Any existing scripts can't do anything at all until you authorise them.**_

All headers have small comments on what you can do and shouldn't.

Here are the GAMADV-XTD3 command used to upload the data to the Sheet.
